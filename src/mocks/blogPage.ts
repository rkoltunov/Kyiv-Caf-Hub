    intro: `
      <p>A croissant is not just dough and butter. It is a test of a baker’s skill, 
      their ability to work with time, temperature and patience. Kyiv has long spoken the 
      language of coffee, but who can say “bonjour” through a croissant? 
      Here is my secret list of those who truly master this art.</p>

    outro: `
      <p>Kyiv lives for croissants as much as it does for coffee.  
      If you are looking for the perfect crunch — go to Franik. 
      If you want a classic without surprises — go to Paul. 
      For gastronomic experiments — Juju or Barbara. 
      Overall, my opinion is subjective, so it’s worth visiting all the cafés to make your own verdict.</p>
